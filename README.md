## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.For explantion of the code-: http://pranavdheer.co/2018/02/05/face-recognition-a-step-by-step-guide/

### Prerequisites

This code is tested on python 2.7 and opencv 3.2.0

```

```

```
Install Dlib
```
## Usage

Ensure that you have downloaded all the files in the same directory
